#### Sample Notes
**110 1-7** This psalm contains one of the most exalted prophetic portions of Scripture presenting Jesus Christ as both a holy king and a royal High-Priest--something that no human monarch of Israel ever experienced. It, along with Ps 118, is by far the most quoted psalm in the NT (Mt 22:44; 26:64; Mk 12:36; 14:62; Lk 20:42,43; 22:69; Ac 2:34-35; Heb 1:13; 5:6; 7:17; 10:13). While portraying the perfect king, the perfect High-Priest and the perfect government, Ps 110 delcares Christ's current role in heaven as the resurrected Saviour (110:1) and His future role on earth as the reigning Monarch (110:2-7). This psalm is decidely messianic and millenial in content. Jesus Christ (Mt 22:43,44) verifies the Davidic authorship. The exact occasion of this psalm is unknown, but it could easily have ben associated with God's declaration of the Davidic Covenant in 2Sa 7:4-17

  I. Christ the Kind (110 1:1-3)
  II. Christ the High-Priest (110: 4-7)

**110:1 My Lord**. Refers to the divine/human King of Israel--the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ's humanity descended from David, which is demanded by the Davidic promise of 2Sa 7:12. Using this passage, CChrist also delcared His deity in the gospels (Mt 22:44, Mk 12:36; Lk 20:42-43) by arguing that only God could have been lord to King David. **My right hand**. God the Father invited God the Son in His ascension to sit at the place of honer in the heavenly throgne room (cf. Ac. 2::22-36; Heb 10:10-12). **Your enemies a footstool**. Footstool was an ancient Near Eastern picture of absolute victory portraying the idea that one's enemy was now underfoot (cf. PPss 8:6,7; 47:3; Is 66:1; 1Co 15:27). This anticipates Christ's Second Advent (Cf. Rev 19:11-21) as a conquering king (cf. Heb 10:13)

**110:2 Your strong scepter**. From the human side the ancestral staff of Judah is in view (cf. Ge 49:10). The scepter symbolizes royal authority and power that the Messiah will wield (cf. Nu 24:17; Ps 45:6). **From Zion**. Jerusalem, the earthly capital from which Christ will rule during His millennial kingdom (cf. Is 2:3; Mic 4:2). **Rule in the midst of Your enemies**. Christ will exercise dominion even while surrounded by opposition, ultimately subduing all who resist His reign (cf. Ps 2:8-9; Rev 19:15).

**110:3 Your people will volunteer freely**. The Messiah's subjects will willingly submit themselves and serve Him with joyful hearts, offering themselves without compulsion (Jdg 5:2; 2Co 8:3). **In the day of Your power**. This refers to the time when Christ returns to establish His kingdom on earth (Zec 14:3-9; Rev 19:11-16). **In holy array**. The people will be clothed in righteousness and will be consecrated for service to the Lord (Is 52:1; Rev 19:8). **From the womb of the dawn**. Just as dew appears fresh each morning, the king's followers will be continually renewed and will be numerous like the morning dew (Is 26:19; Mic 5:7).
