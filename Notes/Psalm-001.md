## Study Notes

**1:1 Blessed**. This word describes the state of true happiness and spiritual prosperity that comes from living in right relationship with God (Ps 32:1-2; 112:1; Mt 5:3-12). **Walk... stand... sit**. These three verbs show a progression of increasing involvement with sin, moving from casual association to settled commitment in wickedness. **Counsel of the wicked**. This refers to the advice, plans, and way of thinking of those who live without regard for God (Ps 2:1-2; Pr 1:10-19).

**1:2 His delight is in the law of the LORD**. The righteous person finds joy and pleasure in God's Word, viewing it not as a burden but as a treasure (Ps 119:16, 35, 47, 92, 97). **Meditates day and night**. This means to think deeply about, ponder, and reflect on God's Word continually, allowing it to shape one's thoughts and actions (Jos 1:8; Ps 119:15, 48, 78, 148).

**1:3 Like a tree firmly planted**. The righteous person is compared to a tree with deep roots near streams of water, indicating stability, nourishment, and spiritual vitality (Jer 17:7-8; Ezek 47:12). **Yields its fruit in its season**. This describes the productive life of one who follows God, bearing spiritual fruit at the appropriate time (Jer 17:8; Mt 7:17-20; Gal 5:22-23; Col 1:10). **Its leaf does not wither**. This indicates ongoing spiritual health and vitality, even in difficult circumstances (Ezek 47:12). **In whatever he does, he prospers**. True prosperity comes from following God's ways, though this may not always mean material wealth (Jos 1:8; Ps 128:1-2; 3 Jn 1:2).

**1:4 Like chaff**. In contrast to the firmly planted tree, the wicked are compared to worthless husks of grain that the wind easily blows away during harvest (Job 21:18; Ps 35:5; Is 17:13; Hos 13:3). This imagery shows their instability, worthlessness, and lack of substance.

**1:5 The wicked will not stand in the judgment**. When God brings His final judgment, the wicked will have no defense and will be unable to withstand His verdict (Ps 76:7; Nah 1:6; Mal 3:2; Rev 6:17). **Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous**. The wicked will be separated from God's people and excluded from their fellowship both now and in eternity (Ps 26:4-5; Mt 13:41-43; 25:31-46).

**1:6 The LORD knows the way of the righteous**. God intimately knows, approves of, and watches over the lives of those who follow Him (Ps 37:18; 101:6; 139:1-6; Jn 10:14, 27; 2 Tim 2:19). **The way of the wicked will perish**. The path chosen by those who reject God leads to ultimate destruction and ruin (Pr 14:12; Mt 7:13-14; 2 Pet 2:12).
