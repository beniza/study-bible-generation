## Study Notes

**1 In the beginning was the Word**. Jesus existed before all creation, proving He is more than a human teacher or prophet (Genesis 1:1; Proverbs 8:22-23). **The Word was with God, and the Word was God**. Jesus shares the same divine nature as God the Father, establishing His credentials as the divine Messiah (Colossians 2:9; Philippians 2:6).

**3 All things came into being through Him**. The Messiah is the Creator of all things, demonstrating His divine power (Colossians 1:16; Hebrews 1:2).

**4 In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men**. The Messiah is the source of spiritual life, bringing light to those in darkness (John 8:12; 14:6).

**9 There was the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man**. The Messiah came into the world to bring spiritual understanding to all people (John 8:12; 12:46).

**11 He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him**. The Messiah came first to Israel, but many rejected Him despite the prophecies pointing to His coming (Isaiah 53:3; Matthew 21:42-43).

**12 As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God**. Those who believe in the Messiah receive the privilege of becoming God's children (Romans 8:15-17; Galatians 3:26).

**14 The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us**. The Messiah took on human nature to live among His people, fulfilling prophecies of God with us (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23). **We saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth**. The disciples witnessed the Messiah's divine glory revealed in His life (John 2:11; 2 Peter 1:16-17).

**17 The Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ**. The Messiah brought the full revelation of God's grace that the Law could only point toward (Romans 6:14; Hebrews 10:1).

**18 No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him**. The Messiah alone can fully reveal God because He is God's Son (John 14:9; Colossians 1:15).

**23 I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord'**. John the Baptist fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy about the messenger preparing the way for the Messiah (Isaiah 40:3; Malachi 3:1).

**29 Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world**. John identified Jesus as the Messiah who would be the ultimate sacrifice for sin (Isaiah 53:7; 1 Peter 1:19).

**32 I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him**. God confirmed Jesus' identity as the Messiah by sending the Holy Spirit upon Him (Isaiah 11:2; Matthew 3:16).

**34 I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God**. John the Baptist gave eyewitness testimony that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God (Matthew 3:17; John 20:31).

**41 We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ)**. Andrew immediately recognized Jesus as the promised Messiah, the Anointed One sent by God (Daniel 9:25-26; John 4:25).

**45 We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth**. Philip understood that Jesus fulfilled all the Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah (Deuteronomy 18:15; Luke 24:27).

**47 Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit**. Jesus demonstrated supernatural knowledge, a sign of the Messiah (1 Samuel 16:7; John 2:25).

**49 Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel**. Nathanael confessed Jesus as the Messiah after witnessing His divine knowledge (Psalm 2:6-7; Zephaniah 3:15).

**51 You will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man**. Jesus revealed that He is the connection between heaven and earth, fulfilling the role of Messiah as mediator (Genesis 28:12; 1 Timothy 2:5).
