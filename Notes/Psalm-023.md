## Study Notes

**23:1 The LORD is my shepherd**. This declares a personal relationship with God, who cares for His people as a shepherd cares for his sheep with provision, guidance, and protection (Gen 48:15; Ps 80:1; Is 40:11; Ezek 34:11-16; Jn 10:11, 14). **I shall not want**. Because the LORD is our shepherd, we will lack nothing that is truly necessary for our well-being and spiritual life (Ps 34:9-10; Phil 4:19).

**23:2 He makes me lie down in green pastures**. God provides rest and abundant nourishment for His people, leading them to places of spiritual refreshment and provision (Ezek 34:14-15; Rev 7:17). **He leads me beside quiet waters**. The shepherd guides His sheep to still, peaceful waters where they can drink safely, symbolizing the peace and refreshment God provides (Is 49:10; Rev 7:17).

**23:3 He restores my soul**. God renews and revives the spiritual life of His people when they are weary, weak, or have wandered from His path (Ps 19:7; 51:12; Lam 1:16). **He guides me in the paths of righteousness**. The Lord directs His people in right living and godly conduct according to His will (Ps 25:4-5; 31:3; 143:8-10; Pr 3:5-6). **For His name's sake**. God acts for the glory and honor of His own name, maintaining His reputation as a faithful shepherd (Ps 25:11; 31:3; 79:9; Is 48:11; Ezek 20:9, 14, 22).

**23:4 The valley of the shadow of death**. This refers to the darkest, most dangerous, and frightening experiences of life, including the approach of death itself (Job 10:21-22; Ps 44:19; Jer 2:6). **I fear no evil**. God's presence removes fear even in the most threatening circumstances (Ps 27:1; 46:1-2; 118:6; Is 41:10; Heb 13:6). **For You are with me**. The basis for confidence and courage is the personal presence of God with His people (Gen 28:15; Deut 31:6, 8; Jos 1:9; Is 41:10; 43:2; Mt 28:20). **Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me**. The shepherd's tools for guiding, protecting, and rescuing sheep become symbols of God's care and discipline that bring comfort and security (Lev 27:32; Mic 7:14).

**23:5 You prepare a table before me**. God provides abundant blessing and sustenance for His people, even in the presence of their enemies (Ps 78:19; Is 25:6). **In the presence of my enemies**. God's provision and care continue even when surrounded by opposition, demonstrating His power to protect and provide (2 Sam 17:27-29; Ps 31:19-20). **You have anointed my head with oil**. Anointing with oil was a sign of honor, joy, and festive celebration, showing God's special favor and blessing (Ps 92:10; 104:15; Eccl 9:8; Lk 7:46). **My cup overflows**. This describes God's abundant blessing that exceeds all needs and expectations (Ps 16:5; 116:13; 1 Cor 2:9; Eph 3:20).

**23:6 Goodness and lovingkindness will follow me**. God's covenant love and faithful mercies will pursue and accompany the believer throughout life (Ex 34:6-7; Ps 25:10; 89:1-2; Lam 3:22-23). **All the days of my life**. God's faithful care extends throughout the believer's entire earthly existence (Deut 31:6; Jos 1:5; 1 Chr 28:20; Heb 13:5). **I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever**. This expresses the believer's desire and confidence to remain in God's presence both in this life and throughout eternity (Ps 27:4; 61:4; 65:4; 84:4, 10; Jn 14:2-3; Rev 21:3).
